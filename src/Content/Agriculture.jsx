                                    Food Security, like health, is a critical programme area that will ensure that communities are
                                    empowered, and livelihoods strengthened so that families can become food secure and are
                                    capable of meeting urgent and moderate welfare needs including costs for health care and
                                    education.

                                    PRDA support food security interventions based on communitiesâ€™ own priorities of livelihoods
                                    options. Food security projects in a non-emergency setting is designed, implemented and
                                    evaluated based either on the relatively stable context of Food Security Framework or more
                                    broadly based on Livelihoods Framework depending on the scope of livelihoods activities.
                                    PRDA particularly use the DFID Livelihoods Framework or Oxfam Livelihoods Framework,
                                    both of which provides the specific livelihoods facets or dimensions to guide the design,
                                    implementation and evaluation focus.

                                    We support activities that are adapted and framed
                                    in the contexts of the changing conflict transformation process. Among the food security
                                    activities to be supported are: seeds and tools, fishing gears within the areas where there is
                                    fishing, community training in livelihoods skills including managing IGAs and VSLAs, livestock
                                    management, among others.

                                    PRDA in this sector work collaboratively with key food security
                                    agencies including WFP, IOM, UNDP, Oxfam and FAO to coordinate actions and increase
                                    impact. Attention is particularly given to managing food security projects within the resilience
                                    framework to ensure strengthened capacity and sustainability.
