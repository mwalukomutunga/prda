                                    South Sudan has always been bedevilled by disasters after disaster that when they come they
                                    affect many people because of unpreparedness and other factors that make them even more
                                    vulnerable like poverty and lack of appropriate Health services at the community level. The
                                    returnees also suffer more due to poor environment they operate into with sporadic insecurity
                                    countrywide.

                                    When flooding occurred in Pochalla between July and November 2020, PRDA sourced some
                                    funds from Partners, Mission 21 and Church of Scotland that were used to purchase some food
                                    and non-food items that were ferried to site. Over 3000 households benefitted through this
                                    intervention.</p>
